I am currently a PhD student in the Rice University, working with [Konstantinos Mamouras](https://kmamouras.github.io/). I graduated from Chennai Mathematical Institute with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2019.

My research interests are broadly along the lines of formal methods, programming languages and automata theory. As part of my PhD research, I am working on monitoring algorithms for quantitative interpretations of temporal logic, and also on algorithms related to regular expressions with practical extensions such as counting and lookaround assertions.
