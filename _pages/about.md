I am currently a PhD student in the Rice University, working with [Konstantinos Mamouras](https://mamouras.web.rice.edu). I graduated from Chennai Mathematical Institute with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2019.

My research interests are broadly along the lines of formal methods, programming languages and automata theory. I have recently been working on monitoring algorithms for quantitative interpretations of temporal logic.
