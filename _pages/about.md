I am an engineer at [Imiron](https://imiron.io/), where we use [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) to build tools which ascertain the safety of software or cyber-physical systems. Our work is in close collaboration with the [ERATO-MMSD](https://group-mmm.org/eratommsd/) group, in the [National Institute of Informatics](https://www.nii.ac.jp/en/), where I formerly served as a scientific programmer.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rice University in 2024, under the supervision of [Konstantinos Mamouras](https://kmamouras.github.io/). Prior to that, I graduated from Chennai Mathematical Institute with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics in 2019.

My research interests include formal methods and programming languages. My [thesis](/assets/pdf/thesis-24-08-08.pdf) explores the Coq formalization of algorithms related to temporal logic and regular expressions. I am also intersted in the theoretical aspects of automata and logic.

You can find my CV [here](direct-html/resume/resume2024.htm).
